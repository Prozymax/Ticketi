Introduction
We at Ticketi respect your concerns about privacy.
This Privacy Notice explains how Ticketi (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, stores, and
shares information from users (“you”). It also describes measures we take to protect user
information. It applies to the Ticketi website, mobile applications, and related services
(collectively, the “Service”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
transparency in our data practices, especially given our use of blockchain technology for
secure ticketing.
Collection and Use of User Information
“User information” hereinafter refers to information gotten from the Pi SDK.
You may browse parts of our Service without providing user information. However, to
purchase or sell tickets, create events, or access certain features, we may collect user
information, such as:
• User Account Information: As accessible from the Pi SDK, used to access Ticketi
products and services.
• Event and Ticketing Information: Details related to events you organize or attend,
including event names, dates, locations, and ticket purchase history.
• Payment Information: Gotten from the Pi SDK and transaction history for ticket
purchases or event payouts.
• Communication Records: Interactions via in-app chat, customer support, or
feedback forms.
• Geolocation Data: Location data (e.g., city or region) to recommend local events or
verify event attendance, with your consent.
• User Generated Content: Reviews, ratings, or event related content you submit.
We may also collect information from third parties (e.g., blockchain networks, social
media platforms, or analytics providers) to enhance our services or prevent fraud.
Collection and Use of Non-User Information
We automatically collect non-user information, such as:
− Browser type, device characteristics, operating system, and language preferences.
− IP address, unique device identifiers, and clickstream data.
− Usage patterns, such as pages visited or events viewed.
− Blockchain transaction metadata (e.g., transaction IDs, without user identifiers).
This data helps us improve the Service, customize content, and analyze trends. We may
use third-party analytics tools or cookies, subject to their privacy policies. You can
manage cookie preferences via your browser settings, but disabling cookies may limit
Service functionality.
How Ticketi Uses Your Information
We use your information to:
• Facilitate ticket purchases, sales, and event management.
• Process cryptocurrency payments and payouts to Event Organizers.
• Provide customer support and respond to inquiries.
• Verify ticket authenticity and prevent scalping via blockchain technology.
• Recommend events based on your preferences or location.
• Send transactional notifications (e.g., ticket purchase confirmations) or marketing
communications.
• Conduct data analytics to improve our business/service (including but not limited
to developing new products and services; managing our communications;
determining the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and advertising; analysing
and enhancing our products, services, websites and apps; ensuring the security of
our networks and information systems; performing accounting, auditing, invoicing,
reconciliation and collection activities; and reviewing, improving and maintaining
the quality of our customer services), detect fraud, or enhance user experience.
• Comply with applicable legal obligations, such as tax reporting or fraud
investigations.
• Establish, exercise and defend legal claims
• Manage accounts and ensure platform security.
Blockchain Specific Information
Ticketi uses blockchain technology to issue and verify tickets, ensuring transparency and
security. Blockchain transactions (e.g., ticket purchases or transfers) are recorded on a
public ledger, which may include your wallet address and transaction details. This data is
pseudonymized but publicly accessible due to the nature of blockchain. We do not link
wallet addresses to your user information unless required for service delivery or legal
compliance.
Information We Share
We do not sell your user information. We may share information as follows:
• With Event Organizers: To facilitate ticket verification or event management (e.g.,
attendee names or contact details, where necessary).
• With Service Providers: Third parties performing services like payment processing,
analytics, or customer support, bound by confidentiality agreements.
• With Blockchain Networks: Transaction data (e.g., wallet addresses) shared with
blockchain networks for ticket issuance or verification.
• With Affiliates or Partners: For marketing or operational purposes, subject to this
Privacy Notice.
• For Legal Reasons: To comply with laws, regulations, or legal processes (e.g., court
orders), or to prevent fraud, harm, or illegal activity.
• In Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of Ticketi’s
assets.
Your Options
You may:
Opt out of marketing emails by clicking “Unsubscribe” in our emails or contacting us.
Withdraw consent for certain data processing (e.g., geolocation) by contacting us, though
this may limit Service functionality.
Request access, correction, or deletion of your user information (subject to legal
obligations) via your Ticketi account or by contacting us.
Access and Corrections
Subject to applicable laws, you may access or update your account information through
the Ticketi platform. To request access to other user information or correct inaccuracies,
contact us at xxx@ticketi.app. We may require verification to protect your privacy.
Data Retention
We retain user information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this
Notice or as required by law (e.g., for tax or fraud prevention purposes). Blockchain
transaction data may persist indefinitely due to the immutable nature of blockchain
ledgers.
Data Transfers
Your information may be transferred to countries other than your own for processing or
storage. We ensure such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and this
Privacy Notice.
How We Protect Your Information
We implement robust administrative, technical, and physical security measures to
protect your user information from unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. Blockchain
technology enhances ticket security, but public blockchain data (e.g., wallet addresses) is
inherently visible. We advise safeguarding your wallet credentials.
Third Party Links
The Service may contain links to third party websites or services (e.g., event organizer
pages). These third parties have their own privacy policies, and Ticketi is not responsible
for their practices.
Age Restriction
Ticketi is not directed to users under 18. We do not knowingly collect information from
children under 18. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided
unauthorized information, contact us immediately.
Updates to This Privacy Notice
We may update this Privacy Notice to reflect changes in our practices or technology.
Updates will be posted on our website, and continued use of the Service constitutes
acceptance of the revised Notice.
