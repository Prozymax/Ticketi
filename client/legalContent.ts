public ledger, which may include your wallet address and transaction details. This data is

compliance.
<br/><br/>

We do not sell your user information. We may share information as follows:
<br/><br/>

5.0.2 Sharing Categories

<ul>
<li>• <strong>With Event Organizers:</strong> To facilitate ticket verification or event management

<br/><br/>

7.0.1 Data Retention
<br/><br/>
We retain user information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this 
Notice or as required by law (e.g., for tax or fraud prevention purposes). Blockchain

Your information may be transferred to countries other than your own for processing or 
storage. We ensure such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and this 
Privacy Notice.

8.0 Security and Protection
<br/><br/>

8.0.1 Security Measures
<br/><br/>
We implement robust administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect 
your user information from unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. Blockchain technology 
enhances ticket security, but public blockchain data (e.g., wallet addresses) is inherently 
visible. We advise safeguarding your wallet credentials.
<br/><br/>

8.0.2 Third-Party Links
<br/><br/>
The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., event organizer 
pages). These third parties have their own privacy policies, and Ticketi is not responsible 
for their practices.
<br/><br/>

Ticketi is not directed to users under 18. We do not knowingly collect information from

unauthorized information, contact us immediately.
<br/><br/>
