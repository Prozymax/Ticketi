# Pi Network Payment Integration Fix

## Problem

The Pi Network payment system wasn't calling backend endpoints when payments were created, approved, or completed. The callbacks were defined but not actually making API calls to your backend.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `PiNetworkService` (`client/app/lib/PiNetwork.tsx`)

- Added automatic backend API calls in payment callbacks
- Added `callBackendApproval()`, `callBackendCompletion()`, and `callBackendCancellation()` methods
- Added `createPaymentWithBackend()` method for full integration
- Updated incomplete payment handler to notify backend

### 2. Updated `usePiNetwork` Hook (`client/app/hooks/usePiNetwork.ts`)

- Added `createPaymentWithBackend` method to the hook interface
- Provides easy access to the new backend-integrated payment flow

### 3. Updated Demo Component (`client/app/components/PiNetworkDemo.tsx`)

- Added example of both simple and backend-integrated payments
- Shows the difference between the two approaches

## How It Works Now

### Payment Flow with Backend Integration:

1. **Create Payment Record**: First creates a payment record on your backend
2. **Initiate Pi Payment**: Then starts the Pi Network payment process
3. **Automatic Callbacks**: Pi Network callbacks automatically call your backend:
   - `onReadyForServerApproval` → calls `/api/payment/approve/:paymentId`
   - `onReadyForServerCompletion` → calls `/api/payment/complete/:paymentId`
   - `onCancel` → calls `/api/payment/cancel/:paymentId`

## Usage Examples

### Simple Payment (Original Method)

```typescript
const {createPayment} = usePiNetwork();

const paymentId = await createPayment(
  1.0, // amount
  "Test payment", // memo
  {eventId: "123"} // metadata
);
```

### Backend-Integrated Payment (New Method)

```typescript
const {createPaymentWithBackend} = usePiNetwork();

const result = await createPaymentWithBackend(
  "ticket_123", // ticketId
  2, // quantity
  "event_123", // eventId
  2.0, // amount
  "Ticket purchase", // memo (optional)
  {ticketType: "regular"} // metadata (optional)
);

console.log("Pi Payment ID:", result.paymentId);
console.log("Backend Payment ID:", result.backendPaymentId);
```

## Backend Endpoints Used

Your existing backend endpoints are now automatically called:

- `POST /api/payment/create` - Creates payment record
- `POST /api/payment/approve/:paymentId` - Approves payment
- `POST /api/payment/complete/:paymentId` - Completes payment
- `POST /api/payment/cancel/:paymentId` - Cancels payment
- `POST /api/payment/on-incomplete` - Handles incomplete payments

## Key Benefits

1. **Automatic Backend Sync**: Payments are automatically synchronized with your backend
2. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for both Pi Network and backend failures
3. **Purchase Tracking**: Creates purchase records before initiating payments
4. **Backward Compatible**: Original `createPayment` method still works
5. **Full Integration**: Handles the complete payment lifecycle

## Testing

Use the updated `PiNetworkDemo` component to test both payment methods:

- Simple payment: Tests Pi Network integration only
- Backend payment: Tests full integration with your backend

## Example Component

See `client/app/examples/PaymentExample.tsx` for a complete ticket purchase example that shows how to use the new backend-integrated payment system in a real-world scenario.

The payment system now properly integrates with your backend and will handle the complete payment lifecycle automatically!
